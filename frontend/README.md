## Frontend: GitHub Pages static (inherits from next-template)

### How it works
- This folder was copied from `../next-template` and is safe to modify.
- Static export for GitHub Pages is enabled in `next.config.js`.
- Runtime config lives in `public/config.json`.

### Steps
1) Edit `public/config.json` with your backend and Supabase settings.
2) `npm ci` then `npm run build` (or run CI).
3) Push to `main` to deploy via `.github/workflows/pages.yml`.

### Subpath deploy
- If this site is published under `/repo`, set `basePath` and `assetPrefix` in `next.config.js` accordingly.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
